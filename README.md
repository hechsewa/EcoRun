EcoRun is a desktop, old-school platformer game with an eco-friendly message. The game was developed using libGDX platform.

## Aim of the game ## 

The main aim of the game is to collect all the trash and put them in separate bins - paper, metal, plastic. Hopefully, it teaches kids (and adults) what bins are what color and help them separate trash in real life too. While playing, you have to avoid angry plastic bags, oil spills and drowning. When approaching a PM10 cloud, you have to wear a mask to pass. Collect leaves for score. You can only pass to the next level, when you collect all the trash, so don't miss anything.

Controls:
* up arrow - jump
* left and right arrow - run
* space - pause the game
